# Loan Qualifier Program

This program is designed to assist our firm's clientele in matching their financial needs with lending opportunties. By creating an avenue for users to input their financial data, this program in turn automates filtering through available lenders to connect both parties and assist in the lending process. If multiple lending options are avaialable, this program allows for an output file for the client to review and make the best choice for their needs.

## Usage

To operate this program, open up your terminal of choice and navigate to the directory in which you have downloaded the files within this repository. Utilize the command '''python app.py''' to initate the program within your command line interface. It will prompt you to load the intial loan file, which is stored within your data folder. Next it will ask you to input a series of your financial data points, and will then tell you if/how many qualified loans meet your needs. Finally, it will ask if you wish to save these filtered loans to an output file of your choosing. If you choose not to output them, or if no loans met your needs, it will explain as such and then exit the program. This is the end of the program's functionality.
